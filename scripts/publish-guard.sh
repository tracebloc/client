#  publish-guard.sh — stage the public deliverable of this repo and refuse
#  anything else.
#
#  The public mirror of this repo carries a DELIVERABLE, not the source tree.
#  This script builds that deliverable in a clean directory from an explicit
#  allowlist, then runs four guards over what it staged. Nothing outside the
#  allowlist can be staged (exclusion by construction), and four independent
#  scans stand between the staged tree and the push:
#
#    1. [allowlist]          .publish-include names what MAY ship. Tracked files
#                            only (`git ls-files`), matched by glob; a `!glob`
#                            line takes files back out again.
#    2. [forbidden-paths]    .publish-forbidden `[paths]`: names that must never
#                            be in the staged tree even if allowlisted by
#                            mistake (gitignore-style matching).
#    3. [forbidden-strings]  .publish-forbidden needles (extended regex,
#                            case-insensitive) scanned over every staged text
#                            file, in two tiers:
#                              [strings-refuse]  a hit refuses the publish
#                                                (mailboxes, cloud account
#                                                identifiers; the private
#                                                needles from --extra-forbidden
#                                                join this tier and are named
#                                                `private needle #N` in every
#                                                line this script prints or
#                                                writes — the pattern itself
#                                                never reaches a log).
#                              [strings-report]  hits are COUNTED and printed —
#                                                per-needle totals and the ten
#                                                most-hit files — but refuse
#                                                only under --strict. Internal
#                                                ticket references and
#                                                non-production hostnames live
#                                                here until the decision to
#                                                strip them is taken; --strict
#                                                arms that decision.
#                            `[allow]` entries are exact tokens spared before a
#                            needle is re-tested (a public support mailbox
#                            beside a rule that bans every other mailbox): a
#                            token is stripped only as a whole word, case-
#                            insensitively like the scan — `devsupport@…` is
#                            not spared by `support@…`.
#                            A needle may sit in one tier only, [strings-refuse]
#                            may not be empty, and a section header the guard
#                            does not know is refused: each of those is a list
#                            the guard cannot vouch for (exit 2).
#    4. [gitleaks]           gitleaks detect --no-git --redact over everything
#                            staged, default rules.
#
#  FAIL CLOSED. Exit 0 only when every guard RAN and every guard PASSED.
#    exit 1  a guard REFUSED — the message names the guard and the rule.
#    exit 2  COULD NOT TELL — unreadable or empty allowlist / forbidden list,
#            a malformed forbidden list (unknown section, a needle in both
#            tiers, an empty refuse tier), zero tracked files, an allowlist
#            that matched nothing, a symlink in the allowlisted set, a missing
#            or erroring scanner, a guard that did not run, a non-empty --out.
#            "Cannot tell" is never clean.
#  Every guard runs even after an earlier one has refused, so one run reports
#  everything; the exit status is the worst verdict seen.
#
#  Usage:
#    publish-guard.sh --source DIR --out DIR
#                     [--include FILE]           default DIR/.publish-include
#                     [--forbidden FILE]         default DIR/.publish-forbidden
#                     [--extra-forbidden FILE]   more refuse-tier needles (repeat
#                                                as needed); must be readable
#                                                and non-empty
#                     [--assets DIR]             release assets to publish next
#                                                to the tree; guards 2–4 scan
#                                                them too
#                     [--strict]                 a [strings-report] hit refuses
#                                                instead of being counted
#
#  Output: one line per guard, the staged file list, a final verdict.
#  OUT/tree holds the staged tree, OUT/assets the assets; OUT must not exist or
#  must be empty (a stale staging directory could carry a file no guard read).
#  A full findings report is written to OUT/publish-guard-report.txt.
